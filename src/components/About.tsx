              As a developer, I build clean, responsive front-ends using HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript, and React. I'm proficient in version control with
              Git and GitHub, ensuring clean code and team collaboration. I also
              specialize in mobile development, building native Android
              applications using Java. My skill set includes managing and
              querying databases using SQL.

              I believe in the power of technology to transform businesses and
              improve lives. Every project is an opportunity to learn, innovate,
